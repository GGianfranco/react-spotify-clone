## About The Project

> [**ðŸ“º View Demo ðŸ‘€**](https://react-spotify-clone-11925.firebaseapp.com/)

#### **What is it?**

- A web app clone of Spotify with functionalities limited to the following:
  - Authentication
  - Like functionality for playlists and tracks
  - Music player functionality which plays previews of tracks _(30 second preview per track)_

#### **Why is it built?**

- Built for the purpose of showcasing my web app development capability with React, Firebase, and Node.js.

#### **How is it built?**

- First, a Node.js app _(that is not published here on GitHub)_ is created to get playlists and tracks sample data from Spotify using the Spotify Web API. Once the API is triggered to get Spotify sample data, the Node.js app saved these sample data to the Cloud Firestore of react-spotify-clone Firebase app. With sample data already available, react-spotify-clone Firebase app utilizes the sample data through Cloud Firestore queries.
